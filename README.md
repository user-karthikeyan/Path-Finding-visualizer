# Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive pathfinding visualizer using **A*** and **Hill Climbing** algorithms, built with Python and Pygame.

## Features
- Visualizes the A* and Hill Climbing algorithms in a grid-based environment.
- Optimized for real-time pathfinding using threading, reducing animation time.
- Allows users to evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Library**: Pygame

## Getting Started
- You can change a cell into a start node ðŸŸ¦ / end node ðŸŸ© / a block â¬› by **clicking** the cell.
- ðŸŸª denotes the path found by the algorithm
- Light ðŸŸ§ denotes the node that are visited, Dark ðŸŸ§ denotes the node that are in queue but not yet visited.
- Simulation starts on hitting **space** and clearing results by hitting **c**.
